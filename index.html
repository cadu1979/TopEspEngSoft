        <p style="width: 400px; text-align: justify;">In the 8th century BC, 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece" target="_blank">Greece</a> began to emerge from the Dark Ages, 
            which followed the collapse of the Mycenaean civilization. Literacy had been lost and the Mycenaean script 
            forgotten, but the Greeks adopted the Phoenician alphabet, modifying it to create the Greek alphabet.
            A mercantile class arose in the first half of the 7th century BC, shown by the introduction of coinage in 
            about 680 BC.[17] This seems to have introduced tension to many city-states, as their aristocratic regimes 
            were threatened by the new wealth of merchants ambitious for political power.
            By the 6th century BC, several cities had emerged as dominant in Greek affairs: Athens, Sparta, Corinth, and 
            Thebes. Each of them had brought the surrounding rural areas and smaller towns under their control, and Athens 
            and Corinth had become major maritime and mercantile powers as well.

        </div>

        <p style="width: 400px; text-align: justify;">In 499 BC, the Ionian city states under Persian rule rebelled against their 
            Persian-supported tyrant rulers. Supported by troops sent from Athens and Eretria, they advanced as far as Sardis 
            and burnt the city before being driven back by a Persian counterattack.
            Ten years later, a second invasion was launched by Darius' son Xerxes. The city-states of northern and central Greece 
            submitted to the Persian forces without resistance, but a coalition of 31 Greek city states, including Athens and Sparta, 
            determined to resist the Persian invaders. The Persians were decisively defeated at sea by a primarily Athenian naval 
            force at the Battle of Salamis, and on land in 479 BC at the Battle of Plataea.
            As the Athenian fight against the Persian empire waned, conflict grew between Athens and Sparta. These tensions were 
            exacerbated in 462 BC when Athens sent a force to aid Sparta in overcoming a helot revolt, but this aid was rejected by 
            the Spartans.
            The exhaustion of the Greek heartland coincided with the rise of Macedon, led by Philip II. In twenty years, Philip 
            had unified his kingdom, expanded it north and west at the expense of Illyrian tribes.

                <p><em>Alexander's Successors: First War of the Diadochi 322–320 BC</em></p>
            </aside>
        </div>

        <p style="width: 400px; text-align: justify;">The Hellenistic period lasted from 323 BC, the end of the wars 
            of Alexander the Great, to the annexation of Greece by the Roman Republic in 146 BC. After the death of 
            Alexander, his empire was, after quite some conflict, divided among his generals, resulting in the 
            Ptolemaic Kingdom (Egypt and adjoining North Africa), the Seleucid Empire (the Levant, Mesopotamia and 
            Persia) and the Antigonid dynasty (Macedonia).
            The conquests of Alexander had numerous consequences for the Greek city-states. It greatly widened the 
            horizons of the Greeks and led to a steady emigration of the young and ambitious to the new Greek empires 
            in the east. 
            The Antigonid Kingdom became involved in a war with the Roman Republic in the late 3rd century. Although 
            the First Macedonian War was inconclusive, the Romans, in typical fashion, continued to fight Macedon 
            until it was completely absorbed into the Roman Republic (by 149 BC).

            </aside>
        </div>

        <p style="width: 400px; text-align: justify;">The Greek peninsula came under Roman rule during the 146 BC 
            conquest of Greece after the Battle of Corinth. Macedonia became a Roman province while southern Greece 
            came under the surveillance of Macedonia's prefect; however, some Greek poleis managed to maintain a 
            partial independence and avoid taxation. Athens and other Greek cities revolted in 88 BC, and the peninsula 
            was crushed by the Roman general Sulla. The Roman civil wars devastated the land even further, until 
            Augustus organized the peninsula as the province of Achaea in 27 BC. 
            During the 2nd and 3rd centuries, Greece was divided into provinces including Achaea, Macedonia, Epirus and 
            Thrace. Under Constantine (who professed Christianity) Greece was part of the prefectures of 
            Macedonia and Thrace.
            Greece remained part of and became the center of the remaining relatively cohesive and robust eastern half 
            of the Roman Empire, the Eastern Roman Empire (now historiographically referred to as the Byzantine Empire), 
            for nearly a thousand more years after the Fall of Rome, the city which once conquered it.
